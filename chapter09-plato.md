## Plato

###### ... a longing to return to the realm of the soul...

Sophie woke with a start early the next morning. She glanced at the clock. It was only a litter after five but she was so wide awake that she sat up in bed. Why was she wearing a dress? The she remembered everything.

She climbed onto a stool and looked on the top shelf of the closet. Yes - there, at the back, was the video cassette. It hadn't been a dream after all; at least, not all of it.

But she couldn't really have seen Plato and Socrates... Oh, never mind! She didn't have the energy to think about it any more. Perhaps her mother was right, perhaps she was acting a bit nuts these days.

Anyway, she couldn't go back to sleep. Perhaps she ought to go down to the den and see if the dog had left another letter. Sophie crept downstairs, put on a pair of jogging shoes, and went out.
